<h1>Introduction</h1>

In the dynamic landscape of today's employment landscape, governments face the challenge of connecting eligible individuals with suitable employment opportunities in a timely and efficient manner. This challenge is particularly acute in programs like the 100 Days of Work, where the need to match candidates with short-term contracts requires a streamlined and transparent process. To address this challenge, the government has embarked on a transformative initiative – the 100 Days of Work.
Our project is to digitilize this project.

This groundbreaking project harnesses the power of cutting-edge technologies, Java and Firebase, to develop a user-friendly mobile application that revolutionizes the way job postings are handled and applications are submitted. By embracing the digital era, the project fosters transparency, efficiency, and empowerment within the 100 Days of Work program, empowering both the government and the workforce.

The Need for Digitalization

The traditional methods of assigning 100-day work contracts were often plagued by inefficiencies and a lack of transparency. Paper-based applications, scattered job postings, and manual review processes led to delays, miscommunication, and challenges in identifying the most qualified candidates. This not only hindered the program's effectiveness but also created frustrations for both government officials and job seekers.

The 100 Days of Work digitalization project emerged as a response to these challenges, seeking to transform the program into a model of efficiency and transparency. By embracing digitalization, the project aims to:

Streamline Job Postings: Government officials can now effortlessly post job opportunities, providing detailed descriptions of the roles and responsibilities. This eliminates the need for paper-based postings and ensures that all eligible individuals have equal access to job information.

Facilitate Job Applications: Eligible individuals can seamlessly apply for posted jobs, furnishing their credentials and qualifications through the mobile application. This streamlined process eliminates the need for physical submission of applications and makes it easier for candidates to apply from anywhere, at any time.

Expedite Application Review: Government officials can efficiently review submitted applications, assess candidate suitability, and make informed decisions to accept or reject applications based on the specified requirements. This digital review process reduces administrative burdens and expedites the placement of eligible candidates.

The Significance of Java and Firebase

The choice of Java and Firebase as the project's technological backbone was a strategic one. Java, a modern programming language well-suited for Android app development, ensures the application's compatibility with a wide range of mobile devices, maximizing its reach and accessibility. Firebase, a cloud-based platform, provides a comprehensive suite of services, including authentication, data storage, and real-time communication, simplifying development and ensuring the application's scalability and reliability.


#About the Scheme


The Government of India passed the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 in September, 2005. The Act gives legal guarantee of a hundred days of wage employment in a financial year to adult members of a rural household who demand employment and are willing to do unskilled manual work. The Act will be applicable to areas notified by the Central Government. The objective of the Act is to enhance the livelihood security of the people in the rural areas by generating wage employment through works that develop the infrastructure base of that area.

Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 stipulates that every State Govt. shall notify a scheme and therefore, “Haryana Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme” had been formulated in accordance with the operational guidelines and provisions of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005. The said scheme had also been notified in the Haryana Government Gazette (extra), March, 16, 2007 by the State Government.

#Project Overview


The 100 Days of Work digitalization project is designed to revolutionize the way in which the government connects with and empowers the labor class. By embracing technology, the project aims to streamline the process of assigning 100-day work contracts, ensuring equal access to opportunities, reducing administrative burdens, and empowering eligible individuals to take control of their employment prospects.

#Job Posting:

Empowering the Labor Class: The streamlined job posting feature ensures that all eligible individuals are aware of available opportunities, regardless of their location or background. This transparency empowers the labor class to actively seek employment and participate in the program.

Reducing Information Asymmetry: The centralized platform for job postings eliminates the need for individuals to rely on informal channels or outdated information sources. This reduces information asymmetry and ensures that everyone has equal access to current job openings.

Promoting Accessibility: The mobile application's compatibility with a wide range of devices, including low-cost smartphones, ensures that even individuals with limited resources can access job postings and apply for opportunities.

#Job Application:

Simplifying the Application Process: The user-friendly application simplifies the job application process, making it easier for eligible individuals to submit their credentials and qualifications. This eliminates the complexities and barriers often associated with traditional application methods.

Reducing Administrative Burdens: The digital application process reduces the administrative workload for government officials, allowing them to focus on more strategic aspects of the program. This efficiency translates into faster processing times and quicker placement of eligible candidates.

Empowering Self-Advocacy: The ability to apply for jobs directly through the application empowers individuals to take control of their employment journey. This promotes self-advocacy and encourages active participation in the 100 Days of Work program.

#Application Review and Decision:

Ensuring Fairness and Transparency: The digital review process ensures that applications are reviewed fairly and transparently, based on specified criteria and without bias or discrimination. This promotes a sense of equity and trust among applicants.

Expediting Candidate Matching: The efficient review process expedites the matching of eligible candidates with suitable job openings. This reduces the time it takes for individuals to secure employment and contributes to the overall effectiveness of the program.

Empowering Informed Decisions: Government officials can access detailed information about each applicant, allowing them to make informed decisions about candidate suitability. This ensures that the most qualified individuals are selected for the jobs, maximizing the program's impact.


#Project Methodology


The 100 Days of Work digitalization project employed a hybrid methodology, combining the strengths of agile and waterfall approaches to achieve optimal development outcomes. The agile approach, characterized by iterative cycles of development, testing, and feedback, enabled the project team to adapt to changing requirements and incorporate user insights throughout the development process. This adaptability ensured that the application met the needs of both government officials and eligible job seekers.
